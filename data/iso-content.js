    what_good_looks_like: "Scope and timing of any audit testing on operational systems is agreed in advance with system owners via a rules-of-engagement document - what will be tested, how, when, by whom, with what access, what stop conditions apply, escalation paths if something breaks. Activities likely to disrupt are scheduled for off-peak windows or run against representative test environments where feasible. Audit credentials are time-bounded - issued for the audit period only, with an automatic expiry that doesn't require manual revocation. Audit access is logged in a way that's distinguishable from real user activity (separate user-ID convention, IP allowlist, tagged session) so monitoring teams can filter audit traffic from genuine alerts during the engagement. After the engagement: credentials revoked within 24 hours of close, access logs reviewed against the agreed scope (any out-of-scope queries get flagged back to the auditor), testing tools left no residue (no agents running, no cached credentials, no orphan accounts). The same template applies to internal-audit, external-assessor, regulator, customer-audit, and pen-test activities - the differences are in the rules-of-engagement detail, not the framework.",
    common_pitfalls: [
      "Auditors given broad standing access \"to make their work easier\" - credentials persist long after the audit ends. The audit account becomes the lateral-movement target for the next attacker",
      "Audit testing causes production incidents - pen test sends a million test connections and exhausts the connection pool; data extraction script overwhelms a database. Cited in real post-mortems",
      "No agreement on scope and timing - auditors decide what to test once they're in. Stage 2 finding: the pen-test report shows testing against systems that the engagement letter never named",
      "Audit credentials don't get revoked - six months later, the auditor's account still has access. Auditor finds this themselves on the next engagement and writes a finding against the org",
      "Audit traffic untracked - when something suspicious happens during the audit window, the SOC can't distinguish audit activity from real attack, so they either ignore it (and miss the real one) or chase the audit and burn out",
      "Audit findings provided to auditors directly - sensitive vulnerability information leaves the organization without going through review. The pen-test report includes screenshots of exposed customer data",
      "Pen-test scoping creep - engagement starts at \"the customer-facing API\", expands during the test to \"the internal admin panel because it was easier\", scope of compromise is now wider than authorised",
      "Customer audits (right-to-audit clauses) treated as one-off goodwill events with no protections applied - the customer's auditor wanders the network because the contract said they could"

    scoping_notes: "Pen-test engagements are the most common A.8.34 application - every external pen test should have a rules-of-engagement document covering scope, timing, allowed techniques, escalation paths if something breaks, credential management. Internal-audit access on operational systems is similarly scoped - auditors don't need write access to most things, time-bounding is straightforward, log review afterwards is cheap. Customer audits (where customers exercise audit rights from contracts) follow the same model - scope, timing, access, conclusion.",
