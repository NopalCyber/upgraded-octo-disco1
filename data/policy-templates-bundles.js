    name: 'Operations Security Procedure',
    category: 'procedure',
    description: 'Bundled IT operations security procedure covering monitoring, clock synchronization, privileged utilities, and web filtering (A.8.16, 8.17, 8.18, 8.23).',
    content: `# Operations Security Procedure

${HEADER('A.8.16, A.8.17, A.8.18, A.8.23')}

## 1. Purpose
To define how IT Operations at {{client_name}} monitor systems for anomalies, maintain accurate time across the estate, control powerful utility programs, and filter web access - all foundational technical controls for detecting and preventing security incidents.

## 2. Scope
All {{client_name}}-managed networks, servers, applications, endpoint devices, and the IT operations personnel who run them.

## 3. Monitoring activities (A.8.16)

### 3.1 What is monitored
- Inbound/outbound network traffic at perimeter and key segmentation boundaries.
- Authentication events (success and failure) on critical systems.
- Privileged access usage.
- Critical system and admin-level configuration files.
- Logs from security tools (EDR, IDS/IPS, web filter, firewall, DLP).
- Resource utilisation (CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth) for performance and DoS detection.

### 3.2 Baseline and anomaly detection
- {{client_name}} maintains a baseline of normal behaviour (peak/off-peak utilisation, normal access times and locations per user role).
- Deviations are alerted on, including:
  - Activity from known-bad IP addresses or domains.
  - Logon at unusual time or from unusual geography.
  - Unauthorised scanning of systems.
  - Process behaviour matching known attack patterns.
  - Bandwidth or queueing anomalies suggesting DoS.

### 3.3 Tooling
- SIEM aggregates logs from sources listed above; tuned to suppress known-good patterns.
- Alerts route to [SOC / on-call engineer]; runbook defines triage steps and escalation thresholds.
- Continuous monitoring 24×7 for [Tier-1 systems]; business-hours monitoring for the rest.

### 3.4 Response
Alerts confirmed as security events trigger the Incident Response Procedure. False positives feed back into tuning.

## 4. Clock synchronization (A.8.17)

### 4.1 Reference clock
{{client_name}} synchronises all systems to:
- Primary: [pool.ntp.org / vendor-provided GPS-backed NTP / national time authority].
- Secondary: an alternative independent source for redundancy.

### 4.2 Protocols
- NTP for general systems.
- PTP where sub-millisecond accuracy is required (e.g., transaction systems, distributed databases).
- All TLS, certificate, and Kerberos systems depend on synchronised clocks; misalignment alarmed.

### 4.3 Coverage
All servers, network devices, security appliances, building management systems, CCTV recorders, badge-access systems, and end-user devices.

### 4.4 Drift monitoring
- Time drift > [100 ms] alerts to IT Ops.
- Cloud / on-prem drift specifically tracked when both are in use.

## 5. Use of privileged utility programs (A.8.18)

### 5.1 What counts as a privileged utility
Tools that can override normal system or application controls: diagnostic and patching tools, antivirus admin consoles, disk defragmenters, debuggers, backup/restore software, network packet analysers, registry/config editors, password vaults' master accounts.

### 5.2 Restrictions
- Use limited to the minimum number of trusted, authorised IT Ops or security staff.
- Each user identifiable (no shared accounts) - ties into Privileged Access Management.
- Authorisation required for ad-hoc use; documented in change ticket.
- Default deny: utilities removed or disabled on systems where not needed.
- Logically segregated from application software; on networks separate from application traffic where practical.
- Time-bound: enabled only for the duration of authorised work; disabled afterwards.
- All use logged; logs reviewed [weekly] by security.

### 5.3 Segregation
Personnel who use privileged utilities on a system do not also use the applications running on that system in their day job (segregation of duties - A.5.3).

## 6. Web filtering (A.8.23)

### 6.1 Categories blocked
- Known-malicious domains (phishing, malware C2, exploit kits) - blocked.
- Illegal-content categories per local law - blocked.
- Adult, gambling, weapons (per acceptable-use policy) - blocked.
- File-upload to untrusted destinations - blocked unless business-justified.
- Sites with invalid/expired TLS certificates - warned, not blocked, with override option.

### 6.2 Threat-intel integration
Block list updated automatically from:
- Web-filter vendor feeds.
- {{client_name}}'s threat-intelligence sources (per Threat Intelligence Procedure).
- Internal IOCs from past incidents.

### 6.3 Allowlisting and exceptions
- Business-justified exceptions submitted via [ticket / form], approved by [line manager + ISMS Manager], time-bound, reviewed [quarterly].

### 6.4 User awareness
- Training covers recognising phishing and not overriding browser TLS warnings (per Awareness & Training Programme).
- Block pages explain why a site was blocked and how to request review.

### 6.5 Coverage
Web filtering applies to:
- Corporate network egress (always-on).
- Off-network corporate devices (via cloud-delivered filter / always-on VPN).
- Bring-your-own devices accessing corporate resources (via secure browser / CASB).

## 7. Records
- SIEM alerts and triage notes (retention per Logging Policy).
- Privileged-utility usage log.
- Web-filter category change log.
- Time-sync drift reports.

## 8. Review
Reviewed [annually] by Head of IT Operations and ISMS Manager, and after any major incident in the operations domain.

    name: 'ISMS Governance Manual',
    category: 'policy',
    description: 'ISMS governance manual covering context of organisation, interested parties, planning of changes, resources, and segregation of duties (clauses 4.1, 4.2, 6.3, 7.1, A.5.3).',
    content: `# ISMS Governance Manual

${HEADER('Clauses 4.1, 4.2, 6.3, 7.1; A.5.3')}

## 1. Purpose
To document the foundational governance of {{client_name}}'s Information Security Management System (ISMS) - context, stakeholders, change management at the system level, resources committed, and segregation of duties - so that an auditor or new ISMS member can understand "how this ISMS is run" from one document.

## 2. Context of the organisation (Clause 4.1)

### 2.1 Internal context
{{client_name}} is a [size / sector] organisation providing [products/services]. Material internal factors that affect the ISMS:
- **Organisational structure:** [hierarchy summary].
- **Strategy:** [growth / consolidation / pivot - note relevant security implications].
- **Culture:** [risk tolerance, willingness to invest in security].
- **Capabilities and resources:** in-house expertise, gaps filled by suppliers.
- **Information assets:** [headline categories - customer data, IP, financial].
- **Operational and information systems:** [headline systems / cloud providers].
- **Contractual relationships:** [key customer security obligations].

### 2.2 External context

- **Legal:** [contract law, IP, employment].
- **Market and competitive:** customer security expectations, peer practices.
- **Threat landscape:** [headline threats relevant to sector].
- **Technology trends:** [cloud adoption, AI, supply-chain risk].
- **Geopolitical / macro:** [where relevant - sanctions, data sovereignty].

## 3. Interested parties (Clause 4.2)

| Party | Type | Interest / requirement | How addressed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customers | External | Confidentiality of their data, service availability, audit rights | Customer contracts, SoC2/27001 certification, customer-portal SLAs |
| Employees | Internal | Lawful processing of HR data, safe workplace | HR policies, Acceptable Use, training |
| Regulators | External | Compliance with [GDPR/HIPAA/sector] | Compliance Register, breach notification |
| Top management & board | Internal | Risk visibility, return on security investment | MRM outputs, dashboard, board reports |
| Suppliers | External | Clear security expectations, fair contract terms | Supplier policy, supplier agreements |
| Investors | External | Material risk disclosure | Annual report risk section |
| Insurers | External | Demonstrable controls for cyber insurance | SoA, audit reports |
| Public / community | External | Lawful, ethical conduct | Privacy notice, vulnerability disclosure |

This register is reviewed [annually] and on material changes (new product line, new market, new regulator).

## 4. ISMS scope (informational - full scope statement in separate Scope document)
Summary: [in-scope systems, services, locations, business units]. Out of scope: [exclusions and rationale].

## 5. Planning of changes to the ISMS (Clause 6.3)

### 5.1 Triggers for ISMS change
- New or significantly changed products/services.
- New regulatory requirements.
- Significant change in threat landscape (e.g., post-incident lessons learned).
- Organisational change (mergers, divestments, restructure).
- Change in scope (new locations, new cloud providers).
- Change in risk acceptance criteria.

### 5.2 Change procedure
Changes to the ISMS itself (as opposed to operational change covered by A.8.32) follow:
1. **Proposal:** Change initiator submits written proposal to ISMS Manager describing what, why, expected impact on policies/risks/controls.
2. **Impact analysis:** ISMS Manager assesses impact on:
   - Risk assessment results.
   - Statement of Applicability.
   - Topic-specific policies and procedures.
   - Resources and roles.
   - Training needs.
   - Existing certifications.
3. **Approval:** Material changes approved by [Top Management / ISMS Steering Committee]. Minor changes approved by ISMS Manager.
4. **Implementation plan:** Sequence of policy updates, comms, training, and audit-trail updates.
5. **Verification:** Post-implementation review to confirm intended effect; any deviations logged as observations or NCs.

### 5.3 Records
All ISMS-level changes logged with proposal, impact analysis, approval, and post-implementation review.

## 6. Resources for the ISMS (Clause 7.1)

### 6.1 Top management commitment
Top management at {{client_name}} commits to providing:
- Sufficient personnel time, skill, and budget for the ISMS.
- Authority to ISMS Manager and process owners.
- Visible support, including regular review (per Management Review Procedure).

### 6.2 Personnel resources
- **ISMS Manager:** [FTE allocation].
- **Internal Auditor:** [FTE allocation, independent of areas audited].
- **Process owners:** time committed per process.
- **Subject-matter experts:** available for technical reviews, risk assessments.

### 6.3 Financial resources
Annual budget covers:
- Tooling (SIEM, vulnerability scanning, training platform).
- External assessments (penetration testing, certification audits).
- Training and awareness.
- Incident response retainers.
- Insurance.

### 6.4 Infrastructure
[ISMS document repository, GRC tool, audit workpapers store].

### 6.5 Knowledge
Policies, procedures, threat intelligence subscriptions, professional memberships kept current.

## 7. Segregation of duties (A.5.3)

### 7.1 Principle
Conflicting duties at {{client_name}} are separated so that no single person can both commit and conceal an error or fraud, and so that information security controls cannot be bypassed by one individual acting alone.

### 7.2 Conflicting duty pairs (illustrative - adjust to {{client_name}}'s reality)

| Duty A | Duty B (must be separate person) | Where enforced |
|---|---|---|
| Initiate change | Approve change | Change Management Procedure |
| Approve access request | Provision access | Identity and Access Management |
| Develop code | Approve code merge to production | SDLC |
| Operate production system | Audit production system | Internal Audit |
| Use a privileged utility | Run the application that utility manages | Operations Security Procedure |
| Manage encryption keys | Use those keys for production transactions | Cryptography Policy |
| Process supplier invoice | Approve supplier payment | Finance procedure |

### 7.3 When segregation is impractical
For very small teams, full segregation may be impractical. Compensating controls applied: enhanced logging, peer review, management oversight, independent audit. Each compensating arrangement documented.

### 7.4 RBAC and conflict detection
- Roles in the IAM system are designed to prevent conflicting permissions being held simultaneously.
- Toxic-combination report run [quarterly] and reviewed by ISMS Manager.

### 7.5 Review
Conflicting-duty matrix reviewed [annually] and on material organisational change.

## 8. Records
- Interested-parties register
- ISMS change log
- Resource commitment letter / budget approval
- Toxic-combination report

## 9. Review
This manual reviewed [annually] by ISMS Manager and approved by Top Management. Updated whenever clause-4 context, parties, or resourcing materially change.
