## 3. Triggering events
The procedure is triggered by, but not limited to:
- Confirmed unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information.
- Repeated non-compliance with mandatory training, AUP, or access control requirements.
- Failure to report a known security incident in line with A.6.8.
- Sharing of credentials or bypassing of authentication mechanisms.
- Negligence resulting in materialised risk (e.g., loss of unencrypted device).

## 4. Process

### 4.1 Initial assessment
On receipt of a substantiated allegation:
1. The line manager and HR jointly review the facts.
2. The ISMS Manager assesses the security impact and recommends technical containment (e.g., access revocation pending review).
3. Legal counsel is consulted before any formal action is taken.

### 4.2 Investigation
Investigations are conducted in accordance with [JURISDICTION] employment law. The subject is informed of the allegation, given access to relevant evidence, and given a reasonable opportunity to respond.

### 4.3 Determination of severity
Severity is determined considering:
- Intent (accidental, negligent, deliberate);
- Impact on confidentiality / integrity / availability;
- Whether sensitive personal data was involved;
- Prior disciplinary record;
- Whether the individual self-reported promptly.

### 4.4 Outcomes
Possible outcomes range from:
- Informal coaching and additional training;
- Formal written warning (retained on file for [12 months]);
- Final written warning;
- Suspension pending further investigation;
- Termination of employment / engagement;
- Referral to law enforcement where criminal conduct is evident.

### 4.5 Communication
The outcome is communicated in writing to the subject, to HR, and (in summary form) to the ISMS Manager for trend analysis. The detailed record is retained by HR.

## 5. Records and trend review
HR retains disciplinary records for [statutory minimum + 3] years. The ISMS Manager reviews anonymized aggregate data at each Management Review to identify systemic issues that may warrant control improvements rather than individual sanction.

## 6. Right of appeal
Employees have the right to appeal the outcome to [APPEAL_AUTHORITY] within [10] working days of notification.

## 4. Authorised use

### 4.1 Approval
A request to enable removable media for a specific user / endpoint is submitted to the line manager and the ISMS Manager. The request states:
- Business purpose.
- Type of media (read-only, encrypted, manufacturer-provided).
- Information classifications that may be transferred.
- Duration of the exception.

### 4.2 Approved media
Only {{client_name}}-issued, hardware-encrypted removable drives may be used to transfer Confidential or Restricted information. Personal USB drives are prohibited for {{client_name}} information regardless of classification.

### 4.3 Encryption
All removable media containing Internal, Confidential, or Restricted information must be encrypted with a {{client_name}}-approved algorithm and key. Lost / forgotten passphrases follow the standard recovery process.

## 5. Day-to-day handling
- Media in use is kept under the user's direct supervision.
- When not in use, media is locked away (drawer, safe).
- When transferring media to a third party, custody is recorded via courier or in-person handover with signature.
- Media is scanned for malware on insertion via the central EDR.

## 6. Decommissioning
End-of-life media is sanitised per the Secure Disposal and Reuse Procedure (A.7.14):
- Magnetic media: cryptographic erase + degauss + physical destruction.
- SSD / flash: cryptographic erase + manufacturer secure-erase + physical destruction.
- Optical media: shredded.

A certificate of destruction is retained.

## 7. Loss or theft
Lost or stolen media is reported within [4 hours] via the Reporting Information Security Events Procedure. The ISMS Manager assesses whether a notifiable breach has occurred under applicable privacy law.

Sanitisation is performed by [IT_OPS_TEAM] using approved tooling. Each item is sanitised once and verified. The serial number, method, date, and operator are recorded.

### 4.3 Verification
For Confidential and Restricted equipment, verification is performed by a second person ("dual-control"). Verification includes:
- Sample read attempts on overwritten sectors.
- Confirmation of the manufacturer's secure-erase status flag.
- Visual inspection for shredding.

### 4.4 Certificate of destruction
A certificate is generated for every Confidential or Restricted item, listing serial number, method, operator, witness, and date. Certificates are retained for [7] years.

### 4.5 Third-party disposal
Where sanitisation or destruction is outsourced, the supplier is approved per A.5.19 and provides:
- A signed contract with information security clauses.
- A certificate of destruction per item or per batch.
- Right of audit.
