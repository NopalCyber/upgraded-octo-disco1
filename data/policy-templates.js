${STARTER_NOTE}
**Document Owner:** {{document_owner}}
**Effective Date:** {{date}}
**Review Period:** {{review_period}}

## 1. Purpose

To establish rules for granting, modifying, reviewing, and revoking access to {{client_name}}'s information and associated assets, in alignment with business and information security requirements.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all systems, applications, and information assets within {{scope}}.

## 3. Principles

- Access is granted on the basis of a documented business need.
- Access is provisioned at the minimum level needed for the role.
- Conflicting duties are segregated where practicable; compensating controls apply where they are not.
- Access is denied unless explicitly authorized.

## 4. Identity and authentication

- Each user is assigned a unique identifier; shared accounts are not permitted unless [APPROVED EXCEPTION PROCESS].
- Authentication is enforced for all systems holding in-scope information.
- Multi-factor authentication is required for [DEFINE: e.g., privileged access, remote access, access to systems classified as Confidential or above].
- Authentication parameters (e.g., password complexity, lockout thresholds) follow [REFERENCE: organization's authentication standard].

## 5. Access lifecycle

### 5.1 Provisioning
Access requests are submitted via [DEFINE CHANNEL], approved by the information owner and the line manager, and provisioned by [DEFINE TEAM].

### 5.2 Modification on role change
On change of role, access is re-evaluated and modified or removed as appropriate.

### 5.3 Review
Access rights are reviewed [DEFINE INTERVAL - based on risk; commonly more frequent for privileged access]. Reviewers attest to the appropriateness of access.

### 5.4 Revocation
On termination or end of access need, access is removed within [DEFINE SLA].

## 6. Privileged access

- Privileged accounts are separate from standard accounts and used only for privileged tasks.
- Privileged actions are logged and reviewed.
- Where feasible, privileged access is granted on a time-bound basis.

## 7. Compliance

Suspected unauthorized access must be reported through the security event reporting channel. Violations are subject to the disciplinary process.

    content: `# Information Security Risk Management Process

${STARTER_NOTE}
**Document Owner:** {{document_owner}}
**Effective Date:** {{date}}

## 1. Purpose

To define a consistent, documented, repeatable approach to identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and treating information security risks at {{client_name}}, in line with Clauses 6.1.2, 6.1.3, 8.2, and 8.3 of ISO 27001:2022.

## 2. Scope

Applies to information assets and related processes and systems within {{scope}}.

## 3. Risk criteria

### 3.1 Risk acceptance criteria
[DEFINE: the organization's basis for accepting residual risk - e.g., described qualitatively, by score band, by category, or by approval authority.]

### 3.2 Criteria for performing assessments
Risk assessments are performed:
- At planned intervals: [DEFINE INTERVAL].
- When significant changes occur or are proposed (new systems, mergers, regulatory changes, material incidents).
- When the risk treatment plan is materially altered.

## 4. Risk identification

For each in-scope information asset (or asset group), identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. Risks are typically derived from threat–vulnerability–asset combinations, but other valid approaches may be used.

## 5. Risk analysis

Each risk is analyzed by estimating:
- **Consequences (impact)** of the risk being realized.
- **Likelihood** of the risk occurring.

The organization may use qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative methods. [DEFINE: the chosen scales - e.g., 1–5 likelihood, 1–5 impact, with documented descriptors for each level.]

## 6. Risk evaluation

The risk score is compared against the risk acceptance criteria to determine whether treatment is required.

## 7. Risk treatment

For each risk requiring treatment, one of the following options is selected:
- **Modify** the risk by applying controls.
- **Retain** the risk with management approval.
- **Avoid** the risk by eliminating the activity or the asset.
- **Share** the risk with another party (insurance, outsourcing, contractual transfer).

Selected controls are compared with Annex A to ensure no necessary controls have been overlooked.

## 8. Statement of Applicability

A Statement of Applicability is produced and maintained, listing every Annex A control with:
- Whether it is included or excluded.
- Justification for the decision.
- Implementation status.

## 9. Risk treatment plan

A risk treatment plan documents the actions, responsible parties, resources, and dates for implementing controls and reaching acceptable residual risk. The plan is approved by risk owners.

## 10. Monitoring and review

The risk register and treatment plan are monitored and reviewed in line with the criteria in Section 3 and are inputs to management review.

## 11. Records

The following are retained as records:
- Risk assessment process (this document).
- Risk register / risk assessment results.
- Risk treatment plan.
- Statement of Applicability.
- Risk owner approvals of the plan and acceptance of residual risk.
